# Title: How to build inclusive web applications using WebXR and AI

## Overview

When Web applications are designed with accessibility in mind, they work better for everyone. At any given day, any able person might have temporary disability because of having our hands full, or being far away from what we are trying to read. By giving your users multiple ways to interact with your applications, you can increase their comfort and your apps' retention rate. In this talk, you will learn how to use AI services and WebXR APIs to increase your apps' usability.

WebXR Device API is a new set of web APIs we can use to create engaging experiences in mobile web. Great Mixed Reality experiences require your apps to be performant and well designed.
