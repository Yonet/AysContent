# Title: Smart Apps: How you can incorporate AI into your applications

## Overview
Today, smart consumer applications that talks to us, learn our behavior and recommend solutions tailored to our needs are part of our daily lives. We do expect a streaming service to recommend content according to our interests, a delivery service to estimate a delivery time and a virtual assistant to understand our questions. Although we all enjoy these features, we do design our applications without smart interactions in mind.

In this talk, we will discuss what are the considerations to decide using Artificial Intelligence to solve your problems. We will look into [Azure Cognitive Services]() that can improve any user interactions.
Lastly, we will add AI services and improve the performance of our models for a demo application.
