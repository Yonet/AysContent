# Immersive IoT Data Visualization

## Abstract

We are gathering more data than ever before. Are we able to analyze and learn from it? Are we able to access the data in the right context to make informed decisions? 
We have a lot of ways to analyze and visualize data today. Now we have the capability to have the visualizations and data we need at the right time and right place with Mixed Reality Applications. 
We have amazing tooling for native and WebXR development but how do we start thinking about a data visualization in 3D space? How do we make sense of the 3rd dimention? 
What is the process and tools to not get lost in data and space?

In this talk, I will share my experince helping teams build meaningful data visualizations, tools and processes and where to get started with Augmented Reality Development for HoloLens and mobile devices.
