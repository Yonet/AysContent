## Overview

### What is [Azure Spatial Anchors]()?

Spatial Anchors allows you to place virtual object in a specific place in your real world. Spatial Anchors are available in iOS, Android and HoloLens headsets.
Azure Spatial Anchors gives you a way to save and share anchor points in space, so that you can share the virtual objects or information between multiple devices and persist them over time.

### Why Use Spatial Anchors?

Using Azure Spatial Anchors allow you to share any information in specific context, time and space. 
Some of the use cases are having user guides of machinery, inventory information, way-finding applications, educational applications, multi-player games. 
Having smartphones and having access to the GPS data changed the apps we build and enabled ride sharing and location based recommendation applications.
Developing with Azure Spatial Anchors will help you deliver contextual data at the right time and place and will open up new possibilities indoors. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to get started with developing a mixed reality applications, using Azure Spatial Anchors for Android, iOS and HoloLens, using Unity3D and C#.
