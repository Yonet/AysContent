# Title: Sniffing the metaverse

## Abstract:

Over the last decade, AI has been infused into everyday applications, helping us find the relevant information, tell the difference between a dog and a muffin but smelling things for us is not one of them. An electronic nose can detect lung cancer, help in explosive material detection, industrial level food and resource monitoring and more. How can you train your data to solve your specific problems? Once you build your solution, how do you make sense of large-scale real-time sensor data? 

In this talk we will show you how we solve a big developer problem, how to find the freshest coffee in your office building. Beyond solving our first world problem, our demo will walk you through the tools that solve bigger problems on larger scales like   ML, Digital Twins(IoT) and Spatial Anchors(Mixed Reality).

## Objective:

## Five Things Audience Members Will Learn:

- How to train sensor data
- Working with Digital Twins
- Azure Spatial Anchors
- Multi device Mixed Reality visualization
- Meaning of life

###Target Audience:

Level: Intermediate/Advance?
