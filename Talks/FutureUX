Title: Future of User Interaction: Mixed Reality, AI and IoT.

Abstract: 
The ability to capture and share data and learn from it has changed what we are able to do with technology drastically. Although our lives are changed with the new wealth of data, the way we interact with data has changed very little. Just like people a century ago, we are trying to make sense of everything through their 2D abstractions, whether it is writing, illustrations or excel sheets. Today we have the technology to interact with any data in the right context and right space. We can make sense of really complex problems by modeling them in 3d. Our way of consuming information is changing to fit the information itself and becoming more intuitive and actionable. Join us to get a glimpse into the future of user interaction.
