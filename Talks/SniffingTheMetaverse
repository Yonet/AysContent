## Abstract:

Over the last decade, AI has been infused into everyday applications, helping us find the relevant information, tell the difference between a dog and a muffin but smelling things for us is not one of them. An electronic nose can detect lung cancer, help in explosive material detection, industrial level food and resource monitoring and more. How can you train your data to solve your specific problems? How do you make sense of large-scale real-time sensor data? How does Metaverse connect to the physical world through sensors?

In this talk we will show you how we solve a big developer problem, how to find the freshest coffee in your office building. Beyond solving our silly first world problem with AI, we will tell you [the story of the 13 year old who actually use the sensors to detect fungal pneumonia](https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/2022/02/16/how-a-13-year-old-used-my-artificial-nose-to-diagnose-pneumonia).
Our demo will walk you through the tools that solve bigger problems on larger scales like Machine Learning, Digital Twins(IoT) and Spatial Anchors(Augmented Reality) . 
 through the tools that solve bigger problems on larger scales like ML, Digital Twins(IoT) and Spatial Anchors(Mixed Reality).
