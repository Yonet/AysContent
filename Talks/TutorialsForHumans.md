# Title: How to build better tutorials with Mixed Reality Or Tutorials for Humans

## Overview

Remember a time when you looked at a set of instructions, to assemble a piece of furniture or draw a picture, and had hard time following the instructions? If you did, you are not alone. We all have evolved as humans to navigate a 3D world for millions of years. Yet, in the last 2 thousand years, we are trying to represent our 3D world in 2D instructions. Abstracting 3D information on a 2D space has been the most efficient way to transfer knowledge and served us well. Today we are not limited by technology anymore. We can represent information in the right context and the right space. In this talk, we will learn how to use Mixed Reality to create tutorials made for humans.
