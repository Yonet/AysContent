## Overview

Developing Mixed Reality solutions will help you deliver contextual data at the right time and place. You can increase the productivity of your workers, improve the training of new employees and increase the engagement of your users by using Mixed Reality. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to get started with developing a mixed reality application for Android, IOS and HoloLens, using Unity and C#. You will learn how to add Azure Mixed Reality services to your applications like [Azure Speech](http://bit.ly/AzureSpeech)(text-to-speech, speech-to-text, translation), [Azure Spatial Anchors](http://bit.ly/mr-spatial-anchors) and much more.
