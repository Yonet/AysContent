# Azure AI & MR Services

Let's talk about what are the [Azure Mixed Reality Services](http://bit.ly/AzureMRServices) and [Azure Cognitive Services](http://bit.ly/AzureCognitiveServices) and look at some examples to see how they work together to create immersive experiences.

We dive deeper into how to tweak [LUIS](http://bit.ly/AzureLanguageUnderstanding) and vision services to make it work for a specific need. We will also talk about things you need to know to before start working with Digital Twins and Azure Spatial Anchors.
