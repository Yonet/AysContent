## Abstract

The Data Driven Applications gives the ability to incorporate data into an application as well as dynamically share real time operations data. 
When used in Mixed Reality, Data visualizations can enable analysis and insights from the data to help with decision making process in the right place and right context. 
How Data visualization can help making sense of our data is clear to most of us but how to turn data into useful visualizations and get actionable insights is not a straight forward task.
In this talk, we will explore the processes, design decisions as well as technical tools and examples of creating insightful data driven mixed Reality applications.
